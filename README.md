```console

$ every-ts
```

`every-ts` is a utility that can build _any_ version of TypeScript. Yes, that's
right, any version, any commit, even main, v1.0.3, or in between. (If it breaks,
let me know!)

`every-ts` can also be used to bisect TypeScript, without needing to know
anything about TypeScript's build process.

This repo works by making a
["blobless" clone](https://github.blog/2020-12-21-get-up-to-speed-with-partial-clone-and-shallow-clone/)
of TypeScript (to save time and space), switching to the desired version, and
building it. The way to build TypeScript has changed over the years (even places
which don't build with modern Node!), and `every-ts` knows how to build any of
them.

## Switching versions

To switch versions, use `every-ts switch <rev>`. This rev can be anything that
`git` accepts. If `<rev>` isn't found, `origin/<rev>`, `origin/release-<rev>`,
and `v<rev>` will also be tried. You may also pass in a `-dev` version, which
will be resolved to the commit that generated that nightly build.

```console
$ every-ts switch main                # Switches to `origin/main`
$ every-ts switch release-2.7         # Switches to `origin/release-2.7`
$ every-ts switch 1.8                 # Switches to `origin/release-1.8`
$ every-ts switch 1.8~100             # Switches 100 commits before `origin/release-1.8`
$ every-ts switch v1.1                # Switches the tag `v1.1`
$ every-ts switch 5.3.0-dev.20231001  # Switches to the 20231001 nightly build
```

## Fetching new changes

To fetch the latest repo information, run `every-ts fetch`.

## Running `tsc`

To invoke `tsc`, run `every-ts tsc`:

```console
$ every-ts switch main
$ every-ts tsc
Version 5.3.0-dev
$ every-ts switch 1.8~100
$ every-ts tsc --version
Version 1.8.0
$ every-ts switch v1.1
$ every-ts tsc --version
message TS6029: Version 1.1.0.0
```

Alternatively, you can use `every-ts exec` to run commands in an environment
with `tsc` on `PATH`:

```console
$ every-ts switch main
$ every-ts exec tsc --version
Version 5.3.0-dev
$ every-ts exec tsc -p ./path/to/tsconfig.json
```

You can also link TypeScript into your package:

```console
$ every-ts dir
/home/jake/every-ts/.data/TypeScript
$ npm link $(every-ts dir)
```

## Using with VS Code

To get a working path to use with VS Code, run `every-ts tsdk` to get the option
to add to `settings.json`:

```console
$ every-ts tsdk
"typescript.tsdk": "/home/jabaile/work/every-ts/.data/TypeScript/lib"
```

Remember, you still need to use the "Select TypeScript Version" command to make
this active. The setting itself is not enough.

## Bisecting

`every-ts` wraps `git bisect`, building TypeScript automatically. To use it, run
`every-ts bisect` just like you would `git bisect`:

```console
$ every-ts bisect start
status: waiting for both good and bad commits
$ every-ts bisect bad 5.3.0-dev.20231001
status: waiting for good commit(s), bad commit known
$ every-ts bisect good v5.1.6
Bisecting: a merge base must be tested
[0aa49c152d37f97e16ad3d166701d0f7166a635e] Update package-lock.json
$ every-ts tsc --version
Version 5.1.0-dev
# Do something with `every-ts tsc`...
$ every-ts bisect good
$ every-ts bisect bad
$ every-ts bisect bad
# ...
$ every-ts bisect good
$ every-ts bisect bad

$ every-ts bisect reset
```

`bisect run` is also supported. The executed command will have TypeScript's bin
directory prepended to the path, so you can run `tsc` directly:

```console
$ every-ts bisect start
status: waiting for both good and bad commits
$ every-ts bisect new v5.0.3
status: waiting for good commit(s), bad commit known
$ every-ts bisect old v4.9.4
Bisecting: a merge base must be tested

$ every-ts bisect run tsc --version
```
